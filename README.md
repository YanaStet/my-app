# 🚀 React Posts Viewer

> A light and modern web app built to show good skills in the **React ecosystem**, **TypeScript**, and modern design methods.

## 🌟 Main Features

* **Data Management:** It fetches data effectively using **TanStack Query (v4/v5)**. This tool helps load, cache, and update data automatically for a smooth user experience.
* **Navigation:** It uses **React Router DOM** to manage the pages, allowing users to move between sections quickly without reloading the whole page.
* **Design & Look:** The app has a clean and flexible design thanks to **Tailwind CSS** (for quick styling) and ready-to-use, accessible parts from **Shadcn UI**.
* **Safe Code:** The whole code is written in **TypeScript**. This means the code is checked for errors more easily, making the development process safer and clearer.
